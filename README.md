- **Purpose:**
  - Detect employees exceeding lunch time.
  - Identify employees who missed their lunch.
- **Implementation:**
  - Compare `Workhours` scheduled lunch vs. `StatusChange` lunch duration.
  - Excess ‚ûî Flagged as exceeded.

### üö™ Early Logout Detection
**Service:** `get_the_logout_time()`

- **Purpose:**
  - Detect employees who logout before scheduled end time.
- **Implementation:**

### üõ†Ô∏è Skill/Task Compliance Check

- **Purpose:**
  - Detect if employees performed tasks different from scheduled.

### üîî Notification Management
**Service:** `store_notification()`, `get_notifications()`, `mark_notifications_as_viewed()`

- **Purpose:**
  - Store, retrieve, and manage notifications with deduplication.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Deduplication** to prevent redundant alerts.
  - **Role-based filtering**:
    - Managers/Superusers ‚ûî All notifications.
    - Team Leaders (CL) ‚ûî Assigned activity only.

## üß© Technical Implementation Details

### üåç Timezone Handling
- Use **UTC** for storage.
- Convert to **Africa/Tunis (UTC+1)** for display.
- Grace periods (e.g., 5-minute late allowance) are **timezone-aware**.

### üõ°Ô∏è Deduplication Logic
- Prevents duplicate notifications within a time window (default 24h) if:
  - Same text.
  - Same shift ID (`id_shift`).
  - Within last configurable hours.

### üë• Role-Based Access Control
- **Superusers/Managers**: View all notifications.
- **Team Leaders (CL)**: View notifications related to their activities.
- **Employees**: No access to notifications.
