⚙️ Core Functionalities
📅 Attendance & Late Arrival Tracking
Service: still_absent() & current_late()

Purpose:

Detect employees who are absent (no check-in).

Identify employees who are late (checked in after scheduled time + grace period).

Implementation:

Query the Workhours table for schedules.

Compare against StatusChange records (Working/Coaching/Training/Lunch).

No status ➔ Mark as absent.

Status after grace period ➔ Mark as late.

🍽️ Lunch Break Monitoring
Service: get_exceeded_lunch_times_realtime() & get_missed_lunch()

Purpose:

Detect employees exceeding lunch time.

Identify employees who missed their lunch.

Implementation:

Compare Workhours scheduled lunch vs. StatusChange lunch duration.

Excess ➔ Flagged as exceeded.

No lunch ➔ Flagged as missed.

🚪 Early Logout Detection
Service: get_the_logout_time()

Purpose:

Detect employees who logout before scheduled end time.

Implementation:

Compare Workhours.fin (end time) vs. last StatusChange.end_time.

Early logout (≥ 5 minutes) ➔ Flagged.

🛠️ Skill/Task Compliance Check
Service: get_skills_change()

Purpose:

Detect if employees performed tasks different from scheduled.

Implementation:

Compare Workhours.skill (planned) vs. Traitement.skill (actual).

🔔 Notification Management
Service: store_notification(), get_notifications(), mark_notifications_as_viewed()

Purpose:

Store, retrieve, and manage notifications with deduplication.

Implementation:

Deduplication to prevent redundant alerts.

Role-based filtering:

Managers/Superusers ➔ All notifications.

Team Leaders (CL) ➔ Assigned activity only.

Mark notifications as viewed.

🧩 Technical Implementation Details
🌍 Timezone Handling
Use UTC for storage.

Convert to Africa/Tunis (UTC+1) for display.

Grace periods (e.g., 5-minute late allowance) are timezone-aware.

🛡️ Deduplication Logic
Prevents duplicate notifications within a time window (default 24h) if:

Same text.

Same shift ID (id_shift).

Within last configurable hours.

👥 Role-Based Access Control
Superusers/Managers: View all notifications.

Team Leaders (CL): View notifications related to their activities.

Employees: No access to notifications.

🔄 API Flow
